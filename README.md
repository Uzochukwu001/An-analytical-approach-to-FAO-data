# An-analytical-approach-to-FAO-data


## A look at the Food Production Stats in Afghanistan.


This is a project using a dataset of about 59 years of FAO data from Kaggle. The aim was to evaluate the total crops produced, the respective population, and their correlation to different production metrics (harvested areas, yields, and productions) for each year in a chosen country (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan).


was a huge challenge for me too as I had to find time out of my busy schedules to do it, and also, just like many data out there, you may not have all the information you need in most real-life situations. In such a case, you need to know whom to ask and the right questions to ask (this is a discussion for another time). Below is an overview of the steps taken and a short video of the project.

OVERVIEW OF STEPS TAKEN.
·        Listed the different objectives and their underlying requirements.
·        Cleaned the dataset using Power Query on Power BI accordingly.
·        Created a relational model of all necessary tables including DAX measures and derived columns.
·        And finally, produced and formatted the right visuals according to the specified objectives.
·        Laid out the report pages; having a navigation arrow(s) at the topmost part of each page and a date slicer on the second page (which on a filter, synchs with related pages)
