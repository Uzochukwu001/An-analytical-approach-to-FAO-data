## A look at the Food Production Stats in Afghanistan.


This is a project using a dataset of about 59 years of FAO data from Kaggle. The aim was to evaluate the total crops produced, the respective population, and their correlation to different production metrics (harvested areas, yields, and productions) for each year in a chosen country (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan).
