# An-analytical-approach-to-FAO-data


## A look at the Food Production Stats in Afghanistan.


This is a project using a dataset of about 59 years of FAO data from Kaggle. The aim was to evaluate the total crops produced, the respective population, and their correlation to different production metrics (harvested areas, yields, and productions) for each year different countries. It was a huge challenge for me too as I did not have all the information I needed for the analysis which made me to filter for Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Below is an overview of the steps taken and a short video of the project.

### OVERVIEW OF STEPS TAKEN.
- Listed the different objectives and their underlying requirements.
. Cleaned the dataset using Power Query on Power BI accordingly.
- Created a relational model of all necessary tables including DAX measures and derived columns.
- And finally, produced and formatted the right visuals according to the specified objectives.
- Laid out the report pages; having a navigation arrow(s) at the topmost part of each page and a date slicer on the second page (which on a filter, synchs with related pages)
